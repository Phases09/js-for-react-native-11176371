Task 1: This function takes an array of numbers as an argument, iterates through each element, and checks if it's even or odd. If the number is even, it squares the number and adds it to the result array. If the number is odd, it triples the number and adds it to the result array. Finally, it returns the new array with the modified numbers.

Task 2: The formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function. It iterates through each string and its corresponding number, and modifies the string based on the number. If the number is even, it capitalizes the entire string using the toUpperCase() method. If the number is odd, it converts the string to lowercase using the toLowerCase() method. Finally, it returns the new array with the modified strings.

Task 3: The createUserProfiles function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of names and an array of modified names from Task 2. It initializes an empty array result and a variable id set to 1. It then iterates through each name and its corresponding modified name, and creates an object with properties originalName, modifiedName, and id. The id property is auto-incremented starting from 1. Finally, it returns the new array of objects.
